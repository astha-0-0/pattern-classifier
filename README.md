The project presents the development and evaluation of a Pattern Classifier system for hand-drawn image classification for geometrical shapes. Utilizing machine learning algorithms like LinearSVM by importing from scikit-learn and a Tkinter-based graphical user interface, users can draw images and classify them into predefined categories. The aim is to increase the accuracy and other performance metrics in order to get the apt results while classifying. The system includes functionalities for training models,predicting classes, and saving/loading projects. The GUI has been made user friendly to meet the needs to the human-computer-interactions (HCI) Additionally, considerations for scalability and accessibility could be addressed through cloud-based storage and alternative GUI frameworks. Overall, the Drawing Classifier project provides a foundation for further research in hand-drawn image classification, with potential applications in digit recognition, object recognition, and medical imaging.
